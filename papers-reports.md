Cybersecurity metrics, specifically for Cyber Health, have long suffered from a lack of statistical rigor. The origin of this omission is multi-fold, including issues in collection, the inability to cross-compare data, and a failure to apply normalization techniques. The absence of statistically meaningful cybersecurity metrics prevents the ability to compare organizations and efforts over time, and blocks an effective evaluation of cybersecurity investments.
