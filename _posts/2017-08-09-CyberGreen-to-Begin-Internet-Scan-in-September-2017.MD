After conducting a data validation analysis, CyberGreen is announcing that, as of September 2017, it has officially begun Internet scanning for 4 risk indicators (opendns, openntp, openssdp, opensnmp). The full data validation report can be downloaded <a target="blank" href="https://www.cybergreen.net/img/medialibrary/CyberGreen Data Validation Report.pdf"> here.</a> The executive summary is below.

## Executive Summary 

To build its internet health metrics, CyberGreen collects data from third parties using different
methodologies and tools. In order to improve the collection and analysis of this data,
CyberGreen cross-references the data against each other and over time. This report discusses
initial findings about the data and how CyberGreen will use these findings to launch its own
scanning capability.

Our primary observations are that there is a critical need to cross-reference multiple data
sources, as different techniques provide different results. We also note that many of the data
sets are highly volatile, with a large replacement rate for IP addresses in consecutive scans.
